I was looking at a balance between highly conscientiousness to allow smooth execution and high openness to cater for creative problem solving since the market is very dynamic and requires that. When I had to choose between partners with conflicting strengths I mainly looked at how the combination of the two would work together meaning choosing people who are highly extraverted  and those who are moderate to allow for balance. Emotional stability to me was almost a non negotiable because with the pressure that comes with such a situation I need calm partners.",The product launch heavily influenced my decision on who to choose since the roll out is a high-stakes launch due to the years of personal investment I opted to prioritize certain traits. High conscientiousness was very important because  i needed people to be very organized and detail oriented to ensure that everything is checked to perfection. Emotional stability was also crucial since roll outs often come with high pressure and I needed someone who will be able to keep calm and work even with this pressure. I balanced extraversion because clients could be different meaning depending on the client or networking scenario I will have people who can handle any situation. Agreeable was also something I was keen about because being in a team require people who can agree on a solution based on the facts and not just argue to try and prove a point. I was very keen on building a team that would be able to handle any situation or requirement.,28,female,bachelors
